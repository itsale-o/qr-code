## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - to change the default font

### What I learned

This was a good project where a could review mostly my CSS knowledge and habilities.

### Continued development

This project was a great opportunity for me. It made me realize that I deal really well with front-end and solving the problems that might get in the way. I can see myself working with this in the (not so distant, I hope) future. Of course that I'll keep studying and getting better every day.

### Useful resources

- [Converting Colors](https://convertingcolors.com/) - This website converts the code of the colors for whichever format you like (RGB, RGB%, HEX, etc...). Personally I prefer to use HEX format on my codes, so this was very useful to me. I strongly recommend a visit to anyone .
